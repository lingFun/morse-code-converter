Mobile computers
?~The first mobile computers were heavy   and ran from mains power. The 50lb IBM© 5100 was an early    example. Later portables such as the Osborne© 1 and Compaq© Portable were considerably lighter but still needed to be plugged in. The first laptops,
such as the Grid Compass, removed this requirement by incorporating batteries – and with the continued miniaturization of computing resources and advancements in portable battery life, portable computers grew in popularity in the 2000s. 
The same developments allowed   manufacturers to integrate computing  resources into cellular  mobile phones by the early 2000s.

These smartphones and tablets run on a variety of operating systems and recently became the dominant  computing device on the market. These are powered by System on a Chip (SoCs), which are complete computers on a microchip the size of a coin.
